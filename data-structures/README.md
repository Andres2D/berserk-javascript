## Data structures
There are types of data structures:

1. Linear
2. Non linear

### Linear
Elements are arranged in one single dimension. Like:
* List (Static)
* Stack (Dynamic)
* Queue (Dynamic)
* Linked list (Dynamic)

## Non linear
* Tree
* Graph
* Table

### Linked Lists
In this linear data structure, the elements are 
not sorted at a contiguous location, the elements are linked using 
pointers.
Linked lists are more efficient than arrays for insertion and deletion

#### Singly linked list
A node will contain a data (the actual information to store) and a reference (the address for the next node in sequence) for the next node.
The last node will have a reference with a null value, indicating the end of the list.

#### Transversal
Is like a map in array, it visits every node in the list and perform some operation in the data.
